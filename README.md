## Description

Add a more detailed description of what your project entails and set out to do.

This project was my first year exam as a Front End Development student at Noroff. The case for this exam was to make a website for RainyDays, which is a brand that wants to sell jackets so that their customers could keep pushing their comfor zones. It is a simple website where you can have a look at the product from Rainy Days and reed about them.

The site is build up with a homepage who has a list of specifications of the jackets RainyDays sell, and CTA buttons under this list to make it easy for every user to get to either the "jackets" page or the "about us" page.
The jacket page show the "Snowy Jacket" and its price, and has as call-to-action button to get to the page with the product details.
The page also has a "about" page where the user can read about the idea behind Rainy Days and a greeting from the Rainy Days team.

This project is done in the first semester with very basic and simple HTML and CSS, and I also made some wireframes/designs in Figma before the coding. It was a very exciting task to do because I never had done anything that has to do with coding previously, so it was really exciting.

It's worth commenting that there is some JavaScript on this page, which is calling an API to render and show a list of products through a LOCAL page. This part of the code is not in use at the moment and therefore commented out.

## Built With

- Figma (for design)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (very simple)
